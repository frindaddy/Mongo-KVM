Originally, there was meant to be a 4 port USB KVM included. I gave up on the USB functionality, as it will be more expensive than a cheap 4:2 KVM on Amazon (~$20 USD at the time of writing, example [here](https://www.amazon.com/Selector-ZIYUETEK-Switcher-Peripheral-One-Button/dp/B0952L6DRN/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=2VZ6ARXGFL7Y6&keywords=usb+kvm&qid=1663340423&sprefix=usb+kv%2Caps%2C99&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1)).
